# Infrastructure
Repository to manage my personal infrastructure.

This repository contains the configuration files and documentation used to test, deploy and manage my self-hosted infrastructure.

It serves as:
- A single source of truth for infrastructure and services
- A learning playground for DevOps, SRE, and platform engineering concepts
- A reproducible and documented setup for experimentation and automation

## Tech Stack

The homelab is built using a combination of the following tools:

- Terraform/OpenTofu: Infrastructure provisioning
- Ansible: Configuration management and host provisioning
- Docker / Docker Compose: Application and service orchestration
